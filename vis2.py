"""Quick hack to produce a visualization of color usage in McCarthy's novel
The Road. Data included is based on http://is.gd/road_colors; incomplete info
or other errors should be reported as noted on that page.

This script produces one three-pixel-wide bar for color mention in the novel,
regardless of what other colors may be mentioned on that page or how long it's
been since a color was mentioned.

This is, after all, a quick hack, not a producer of a beautiful visualization,
and some of my concerns are documented somewhat in the docstring for the 
vis1.py script. Those apply here, too.

I'd love suggestions on how to do this better. This is a first attempt.
